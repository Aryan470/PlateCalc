Firmware for a handheld barbell loading calculator, on my own PCB.

I built a handheld calculator to keep me off my phone in the gym, so I could just type in the weight I wanted and know what I needed to load on the bar.

To do this, I designed a PCB, wrote firmware for the raspberry pi pico, interfaced it with the LCD and keypad, and stuck the whole thing in a 3D printed case.

Before this project I knew nothing about PCB design, firmware, or 3D printing, but after grappling with it for a couple months, I got it done!
